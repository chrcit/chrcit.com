## Idea

- Inflation + grocery prices rising
- Minister for Labour and Economics proposed a state pricer tracker with selected products which might come in fall (add translated link to local newspaper)
- Lukas had the idea to just do this ourselves
- Crawler + FE
- Show in progress screenshots

Preismonitor is a website that ~shows~ showed the development of grocery prices in Austria. I developed it in collaboration with <a href="">Lukas Käferle</a>.

## Launch
- We were last after [heisse-preisse.io](heisse-preisse.io) (Mario), [teuerungsportal.at](teuerungsportal.at) Bernhard und [preisrunter.at](preisrunter.at) David
- Link national news coverage
- Screenshot with usage numbers
- We stopped developing after the launch due to time constraints -> not really useful
  - No UI for aggregate view + limited datax
  - Crawler stopped working in October


## Meeting an Austrian minister
- Answered questions for the Bundeswettbewerbsbehörde[^1]
- They proposed to create a law which would compel large supermarkets to publicise their price data via an API (link to article)
- Got invited with the others to meet the minister and consult him on exact law implementation (link Tweet)
- Why this is cool
- (Hopefully) will come in 2024

We got invited to meet the minister for Labour and Economics to consult him on the exact implementation of the law. We were invited together with [heisse-preisse.io](heisse-preisse.io) (Mario), [teuerungsportal.at](teuerungsportal.at) (Bernhard) and [preisrunter.at](preisrunter.at) (David).

## What's coming?
- Kill our crawler and replace with heisse-preisse data (or maybe government API)
- At some point build a consumer grocery list app which integrates this pricing data
