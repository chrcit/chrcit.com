## Idea to Launch

A <ExternalLink href="https://georgwindhaber.com">good friend of mine</ExternalLink> is active in the youth wing of the SPÖ (the social democratic party of Austria).
They were holding an internal election for the new party leader and the youth wing wanted to create an app to help people decide who to vote for. 

He asked me if I wanted to collaborate on this and I agreed. The concept was modelled after <ExternalLink href="https://wahlkabine.at">wahlkabine.at</ExternalLink> which is a political quiz which helps you find the party which best represents your views.

In around 3 weeks we went from idea to launch of <ExternalLink href="https://mitentscheiden.at">mitentscheiden.at</ExternalLink>.

The three candidates all answered 42 questions via the app and the users could then answer the same questions. After finishing the quiz the user is shown how much they match with the 3 candidates as well as multiple pages to compare their answers with the candidates.

The launch was a big success with around ~27.000 people filling out the 42 question quiz. The app also went viral on Twitter with over 400.000+ impressions and multiple high <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/NicolaWerdenigg/status/1650069601340858368">multiple</ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/pablodiabolo/status/1650068482271182853">high</ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/florianklenk/status/1650134987172200452">profile</ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://x.com/Natascha_Strobl/status/1650056393100083201">people</ExternalLink> sharing it.

It was covered by [multiple](https://www.puls24.at/news/politik/spoe-wahl-41-fragen-und-die-antworten-von-babler-doskozil-und-rendi-wagner/295388) [national](https://kurier.at/politik/inland/test-fuer-nicht-mitglieder-welcher-spoe-kandidat-wuerde-zu-ihnen-passen/402422507) [newspapers](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000145782957/was-man-ueber-die-rote-vorsitzwahl-wissen-muss), TV stations and [meme](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrX6u3nMem0/) [pages](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrYPyLWsp7w).



A question regarding removing abortion from the criminal code resulted in a controversy. The more conservative candidate (and frontrunner) Doskozil at first answered with “no” but after a backlash on social media changed his answer to “yes”.

## Poll results

Before the actual election was held there was an internal poll where every party member was allowed to participate.

The results were quite close:

- Doskozil: 33.7%
- Babler: 31.5%
- Rendi-Wagner: 31.35%

After coming in last in the poll, Rendi-Wagner decided to not run for re-election.

## Election results
The election was held in June and ~600 party officals voted. Initially it was announced that the more conservative candidate Doskozil won with 52% of the vote. 

But a few days later it was discovered that there was a [mistake in the Excel sheet](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/05/austrian-social-democrats-announce-wrong-leader-after-technical-error) used to calculate the results. The votes were flipped by accident and actually the more radical candidate Babler won with 52% of the vote.

## Dev Talk & Youtube Video

In June I also held a talk about this project at the Technical University of Vienna. It went quite well and I decided on posting it on Youtube.

I also posted it on Reddit and Twitter and it got a good amount of traction.

## Joining the organisation

I joined the party and the youth wing and founded the Web Task Force together with [Georg Windhaber](https://georgwindhaber.com).

We are currently working on multiple web projects to campaign for the upcoming national election in September 2024 as well as the EU elections in July.
