I decided to post about Hasanhub on Reddit again but this time on <a href="https://reddit.com/r/reactjs"> /r/reactjs</a>.

I again posted it on Reddit and it got a lot of upvotes.

Hasanhub was launched in April 2022. It was tweeted out by Hasanabi and got around 50-100 daily users. Hasanabi looked at it on stream and said he liked it.

### February

I built the initial version of Hasanhub in February 2022 while I had Covid and was bored.

## Late 2021

I had the inital idea for Hasanhub in late 2021. I was watching Hasanabi on Twitch and noticed that he had a lot of channels that clipped his content. I thought it would be cool to have a website that aggregated all of these channels into one place.
