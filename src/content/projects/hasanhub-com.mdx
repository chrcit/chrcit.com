Hasan Piker (Hasanabi) is a political commentator who streams on Twitch. He allows his fans to clip his stream VODs, upload them to Youtube and monetize them.

Due to this there are 100+ different Youtube channels dedicated to him.

I had the inital idea for Hasanhub in late 2021. It was kinda annoying to find different content related to him and I saw an opportunity to build something that would be useful.

In February 2022 I built a proof of concept while I had Covid. Over the next few months I iterated on it until it was ready to launch.

## Launch
I launched it in April and immediatley got very positive feedback from the community.

At the end of his stream Hasan opened it up while live to 30.000 people:

I also posted it on Reddit:

## Launching v1.1 and making my first online $$$ 

Shortly after the initial launch I refactored the codebase from Next to Remix and added some extra features.

I also added a donate button to the website. I used <ExternalLink href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chrcit">Buy Me A Coffee</ExternalLink> to handle the donations. After the launch of v1.1 people donated around $60.

## Getting featured again on stream
By the end of 2022 the active user count was around 30-50/day. Randomly in December 2022/January 2023 Hasanabi opened Hasanhub again on stream. After that the active user count went up to 300-400/day.

The extra attention lead to people again donating $103 in total.

## Creating a Twitter account

Early 2023 I decided to seperate the Hasanhub Twitter account from my personal developer account. I created <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/hasanhub_com">@hasanhub_com</ExternalLink> to post Hasan related content.
