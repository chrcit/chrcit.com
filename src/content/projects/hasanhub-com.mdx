Hasan Piker (Hasanabi) is a political commentator and streamer on Twitch.
He streams 6 days a week for aroud 8 hours a day.

He has a large number of channels that clip his content and upload it to Youtube. Hasanhub is a website that aggregates all of these channels into one place.

I had the inital idea for Hasanhub in late 2021. I was watching Hasanabi on Twitch and noticed that he had a lot of channels that clipped his content. I thought it would be cool to have a website that aggregated all of these channels into one place.

I built the initial version of Hasanhub in February 2022 while I had Covid and was bored.

## Launch

Hasanhub was launched in April 2022. It was tweeted out by Hasanabi and got around 50-100 daily users. Hasanabi looked at it on stream and said he liked it.

## Launching v1.1 and making my first online $$$ 

Shortly after the initial launch I refactored the codebase from Next to Remix and added some extra features.

I also added a donate button to the website. I used <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/chrcit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buy Me A Coffee</a> to handle the donations. After announcing v1.1 people donated around $60.

## Getting featured again on stream
The active user count on Hasanhub was around 30-50/day. Randomly in December 2022/January 2023 Hasanabi featured Hasanhub on stream. The active user count went up to 300-400/day.

The extra attention lead to people donating $103 in total.

## Creating a Twitter account

Early 2023 I decided to seperate the Hasanhub Twitter account from my personal account. I created <a href="https://twitter.com/hasanhub_com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@hasanhub_com</a> to post Hasan related content.
