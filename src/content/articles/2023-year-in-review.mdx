2023 was a wild ride. I started the year with a new job, got fired after 3 weeks, got involved in politics, made apps for sex positive parties, got a new job, got invited to consult on a new law and much more.

## I launched my first project to 30.000 people


In 2022 I launched my first side project. The political streamer Hasanabi allows his fans to clip his stream VODs, upload them to Youtube and monetize his content. <ExternalLink href="https://hasanhub.com" >hasanhub.com</ExternalLink> is a web app which aggregates 70+ Youtube channels into one feed.

I launched the project in April 2022 and Hasan looked at it on his stream while live to roughly 30.000 people.

## I got my dream job (and was fired after 3 weeks)
In August/September 2022 I spent ~50 hours researching and ideating on a link-in-bio style microsite builder. The concept was that instead of just links to external sites the app would automatically fetch the latest content from Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Spotify, RSS, etc.

I submitted the idea to an incubator but it was rejected. 

In January 2023 I talked about it on Twitter and got a reply from a company called Bento. They were building just that and were looking for a founding product engineer:

After a few rounds of interviews and a <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/chrcit/hackathon-visual-html-editor">1 day hackathon</ExternalLink> I received an offer and accepted it.

For my first week I traveled to Berlin to meet the team:

My first feature was a gorgeous settings UI + some auth related stuff. I shipped it after 3 days:
<Tweet id="https://x.com/chrcit/status/1631688805915787265" />

Besides the regular marketing Bento did I decided to post the feature on Reddit. The post got ~300.000 impressions, thousands of upvotes and hundreds of comments. It also drove a good bit of extra sign ups for the app.

After my second week I shipped new widgets for Figma, Dribbble and Behance:

In my third week I worked on interactive widgets for Spotify which act as mini jukeboxes with beautiful animations:

But before I could ship those I got fired. 

Earlier in the same week I asked to get a few days more time to work on the next feature. I had been working 50-60 hours/week up until that point and wanted to take the weekend off to recharge.

I told my CTO that I couldn't be happy long-term if I had a deadline to ship a big feature every week. He told me that that is startup life and that we'll talk more about it on Friday with the CEO. On Friday I got fired for not being a good fit.

10 weeks later  Bento <ExternalLink href="https://x.com/joinbento/status/1665837936607379456">was sold to Linktree</ExternalLink> only 6 months after it was first launched. This is good for Bento and amazing for Linktree.

I don't hold any ill will towards the people at Bento. In the few weeks I worked there I learned a lot and figured out what I want from a job as well as what I don't want.

## An app I made helped get a socialist elected
In the weeks after getting fired I had a bit of a chip on my shoulder. 

A <ExternalLink href="https://georgwindhaber.com">good friend of mine</ExternalLink> is active in the youth wing of the SPÖ (the social democratic party of Austria).
They were holding an internal election for the new party leader and the youth wing wanted to create an app to help people decide who to vote for. 

He asked me if I wanted to collaborate on this and I agreed. The concept was modelled after <ExternalLink href="https://wahlkabine.at">wahlkabine.at</ExternalLink> which is a political quiz which helps you find the party which best represents your views.

In around 3 weeks we went from idea to launch of <ExternalLink href="https://mitentscheiden.at">mitentscheiden.at</ExternalLink>.

![Screenshots of mitentscheiden.at](../projects/images/mitentscheiden-screenshots.jpg)

The three candidates all answered 42 questions via the app and the users could then answer the same questions. After finishing the quiz the user is shown how much they match with the 3 candidates as well as multiple pages to compare their answers with the candidates.

![Shareables of mitentscheiden.at](../projects/images/mitentscheiden-shareables.jpg)

![~27.500 people filled out the questionnaire, ~3000 hours of usage, ~550 peak concurrent visitors, ~ 400.000 impressions on Twitter](../projects/images/mitentscheiden-results.png)

The launch was a big success with around ~27.000 people filling out the 42 question quiz. The app also went viral on Twitter with over 400.000+ impressions and multiple high <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/NicolaWerdenigg/status/1650069601340858368">multiple</ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/pablodiabolo/status/1650068482271182853">high</ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/florianklenk/status/1650134987172200452">profile</ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://x.com/Natascha_Strobl/status/1650056393100083201">people</ExternalLink> sharing it.

It was covered by [multiple](https://www.puls24.at/news/politik/spoe-wahl-41-fragen-und-die-antworten-von-babler-doskozil-und-rendi-wagner/295388) [national](https://kurier.at/politik/inland/test-fuer-nicht-mitglieder-welcher-spoe-kandidat-wuerde-zu-ihnen-passen/402422507) [newspapers](https://www.derstandard.at/story/2000145782957/was-man-ueber-die-rote-vorsitzwahl-wissen-muss), TV stations and [meme](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrX6u3nMem0/) [pages](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrYPyLWsp7w).

A question regarding removing abortion from the criminal code resulted in a controversy. The more conservative candidate (and front-runner) Doskozil at first answered with “no” but after a backlash on social media changed his answer to “yes”.
The only female member of his team [took the blame for this on herself](https://x.com/JasminPuchwein/status/1650078502559916036).

The incumbent candidate Rendi-Wagner dropped out of the race after she came in last in a party wide poll.

The election was held in June and ~600 party officals voted. Initially it was announced that the more conservative candidate Doskozil won with 52% of the vote. 

But a few days later it was discovered that there was a [mistake in the Excel sheet](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/05/austrian-social-democrats-announce-wrong-leader-after-technical-error) used to calculate the results. The votes were flipped by accident and actually the more radical candidate Babler won.

2 months after the launch I used the project as a case study for my first dev talk which I held at the Technical University of Vienna. I uploaded the recording to YouTube a bit later. It got over 1000 views in a few days and with that I got a first taste for content creation.

## andererseits
andererseits (otherwise in English) is a media startup about/for/with people with disabilities. A good friend of mine told me about that early 2023 and suggested that I could offer my support in their IT systems.

I was quite interested because I have a disability myself due to an accident 6 years ago.
