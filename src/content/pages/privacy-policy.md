## Too long, didn't read

The privacy of our website visitors is very important to us. Therefore, you should know at all times when which personal data is used and how it is used. We are subject to the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the supplementary provisions of the Austrian Data Protection Act (DSG).

As a visitor to this site:

- no personal information is stored
- no information, such as cookies, is stored in the browser
- no information is shared with, sent to or sold to third parties (e.g. advertising companies)
- no information about personal and behavioral trends is collected and analyzed
- no information is monetized

## Complete privacy policy

This privacy policy informs you as a visitor to this website about the type, scope and purpose of the collection and use of personal data.

The following information applies to all data processing within the scope of this website (chrcit.com).

### Links

This website contains links to other websites for information purposes. These websites are not under our control and are therefore not subject to the provisions of this privacy policy. If a link is activated, it is possible that the operator of this website will collect and process data about you in accordance with its privacy policy.

### Processing

#### Visiting the website

When you visit our website, we initially collect some personal data. The following data is transmitted from your browser to our servers

- IP address of the user
- Date and time of the request
- Content of the request (specific page)
- Access status/HTTP status code
- Amount of data transferred in each case
- Website from which the request originates
- Operating system of the user
- Language and version of the browser software

This data collection is initially for technical reasons so that our website can be displayed in your browser.

#### Website statistics

Subsequently, the above-mentioned data is forwarded to our processor (Plausible Insights OÜ) in order to be able to evaluate basic statistics on the use of our website. Your IP address will be deleted in the course of this evaluation. This anonymizes the data that is still used (it is therefore no longer possible to assign this data to you as a website visitor).

The aim is to track general trends in our website traffic, but not to store or utilize data that can be traced back to individual visitors.

All data is only stored in aggregated form. This stored data includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration, information about the devices used during the visit (device type, operating system, country and browser).

Full details of the tool used (Plausible Analytics script) can be found in the Plausible Insights OÜ data policy: Plausible Analytics.

#### E-mail contact

On our website you will find e-mail links (mailto) that you can use to contact us quickly. In the course of such communication, you will sometimes transmit personal data to us (e.g. if your name appears from the e-mail address). Depending on your request, we will process this data for a specific purpose. We will delete the inquiries and data relating to you if they are no longer required and there are no statutory retention obligations.

### Legal basis for data processing

We process personal data on the basis of legitimate interests in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

The collection of your personal data when you access and use our website is technically necessary in order to display this website.

This data is forwarded to our processor (Plausible Insights OÜ) for statistical purposes in order to continuously improve our website. The data processed in this way is first anonymized and only then evaluated or stored.

When contacting us by e-mail, personal data is necessarily processed in order to ensure that these inquiries can be dealt with effectively.

These differentiated considerations are intended to safeguard the interest of our website visitors in the protection of their personal data within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

### Storage period and deletion of data

As soon as the purpose for storing the data no longer applies, we will delete your personal data immediately.

### Processor

We use a processor (Plausible Insights OÜ) for data processing in the course of compiling our website statistics. Plausible Analytics is used to compile anonymous, non-personal statistics on the use of websites.

### Rights of data subjects

If your personal data is processed, you are a data subject within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDPR. You therefore have the following rights vis-à-vis us as the controller

- Right to information
- Right to rectification
- Right to erasure
- Right to restriction of data processing
- Right to data portability
- Right to object to processing

These rights can be asserted simply by sending an email to citochris@gmail.com.

We would like to point out that we do not store any personal data after your visit to our website or in the course of website statistics. Therefore, we cannot comply with requests for information, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, data portability or revocation in these cases.

If you believe that the processing of your personal data violates the GDPR or the DPA, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement, without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.

In Austria, the data protection authority (https://www.dsb.gv.at/) ensures compliance with data protection.
